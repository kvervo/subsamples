# Subtitle Format Test Samples
Diverse synthetic subtitle files for testing purposes
Expected formats:
* SRT
* STL
* Teletext

## STL

Officially known as EBU 3264. Also known as EBU Subtitles or EBU Teletext.

The EBU Subtitling Data Exchange Format (EBU-STL) is a legacy, out-of-band caption file format used primarily in Europe for authoring and interchange.

Official usage data is unavailable, but most caption authoring tools support EBU-STL. EBU-STL files typically have the extension ".STL." The format describes captions using a fixed character set. The format stores a sequence of Text and Timing Information (TTI) blocks. Each TTI block specifies a row of characters, an associated time code, and other metadata. The character codes used for the captions may optionally match the Teletext codes.
